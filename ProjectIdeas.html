    <h2>Project Idea "Herb Gardenz"</h2>
    <p>A website that helps people in the community find locally planted herbs to cook/use. This is using the google maps API where a map will be displayed based on the area you input, this will show the user the local herbs in the area with the ability to click on each one and see photos/descriptions. There will be a separate page where users can add their own sighting/growth of herbs by either using a pin on a map or using an address with other details including an optional photo and description. </p>
    <p>We as a group believed that we could follow Hamish’s project idea as this had the greatest feasibility out of the group and we were not able to come up with something different. This project will allow the people of a community to connect and share by creating a website where they can all share their herbs with the surrounding people. This idea allows people to not pay a large amount of money when needing a small number of herbs. </p>
    <p>Regarding the motivation for this website other than the basic feasibility is because we wanted to create a project that would incorporate a community aspect especially because we considered it extremely important in a post-pandemic world with so many people disconnected. The website’s ability for comment functions and photos on each herb reflects the community ideals and creates a platform where everyone in a certain community can help each other with minimal effort.  </p>
    <p>For cooking, the website allows users to learn what herbs have what effects in a particular dish and it helps them to learn how they can enhance simple dishes with small ingredients. With home cooking, the website also allows users to spend less money on take away foods which are expensive and plastics which are harmful to the environment. It would slowly help in lessening the use of plastics and rubbish and promote and entice users to grow their own herbs from the ones gained. This in turn helps the community even more by providing more plants for people to use. </p>
    <p>For medicine, the website allows users to learn some basic aspects and characteristics of plants which could help with minor wounds. Such as using aloe vera for burns and other minor injuries. The website would help educate people about plants and their uses. </p>
    <p>By creating a website where you can input your postcode or alternatively use your GPS with the google maps API, it will show you both in list form and on the map where to find all the herbs in your area. We plan to add a sense of community by adding an option to add herb gardens that consumers have found/grown themselves; this will increase the websites accuracy with the option for consumers to "like" the location to confirm its existence and how well maintained the garden is. </p>
    <p>Alongside this map will be a list of the sightings/herbs in the area which will update based on the map view, this will include information such as how far away it is, its actual location/address, the name of the herb and how many people have liked and confirmed its existence. The list view will also allow you go to the index of herbs, which will be a list of all the herbs in the area detailing specifics such as names, descriptions, a photo for some, and uses in both foods and potential medicine. The index of herbs will not be accessible to edit from the public in order to ensure reliable information. This index will be a library which will contain information on herbs to use in medicine and cooking, it will provide basic information and then will have redirections to other websites for users to find more information about these herbs. It will also have images of each herb which will allow users to have an image reference when they find a herb or plant they don’t know about. </p>
    <p> The website will be hosted in only English at the start as Australia mainly speaks English though further down the line of the project, there will be options to add in other languages. </p>
    <p>The website's design will very much be comforting and inviting, as it is not a very professional application and is much more for hobbyist cooks and average people the design will be suited to the demographic of being very safe with non-intensive colours mainly focusing on pastels. The user interface will be very standard for a lot of glossary/index websites, but with the focal point of the website being the map. Due to this being a small project bugs are bound to appear even post development, so having a page where people can submit bug finds with details on the bug and how they created it will be very useful. </p>
    <p>The colours of the website would be warm colours associated with the Earth. So colours like brown, green, blue and white. </p>
    <p>A logo for the website would be a stem and leaf growing on the Earth. This idea comes from the encompassing nature of google maps and its reach throughout the world combined with our idea of looking for herbs and plants. </p>
    <p>The input for the map and list will be on a separate page accessible from the header where a user can input the herb from a list that is searchable for the herb they found, small description of the area, an optional photo and the location of the herb which could be a direct address or pin on a map. The reason for the pin on the map option is because many gardens are off the streets, and some addresses will not easily be found. </p>
    <p>The technologies required for this website are quite simple but important, it will need a basic webserver capable of running the google maps API in specific the MAPS JavaScript API as it will need custom content (developers.google.com) this means that my webserver will also be needing to run basic JavaScript. Due to there being custom content and information stored from user input, a simple database will need to be used; something my MySQL or SQLite will be sufficient as to not overload the cloud instance used. For the webhosting, a physical server is expensive these days and something simple like a small website is not necessary, a cloud instance from a provider such as AWS EC2 or Digital Ocean droplets will be needed to host both the SQL server and the web server. </p>
    <p>Regarding the skills needed to create this application, a decent knowledge of both HTML and CSS is necessary to create the visuals and functionality of the site, and a simple knowledge of JavaScript will be needed to implement the MAPS API. Alongside this a decent knowledge of how to use both AWS or other cloud providers including implementing databases into an instance and both pulling and pushing to said database. All these skills can be learnt through various online courses and websites. </p>
    <p>If the project is successful, we believe it will help people, even if it is just removing a minor inconvenience of having to find/buy herbs. As well as removing this inconvenience, we believe websites such as these create a sense of community which strengthens the area that many live in and provides a potential form of communication that would normally not be there. With this website it will be easy to find free and sustainable herbs to use when necessary. </p>
