            <h3>Hamish</h3>
            <p>In the last week and a half of the report all members of the group really kicked into gear and were offering help and getting started on all their delegations. These delegations set out well with it done early and everyone from the very start understood their place in the report. On top of these well set out delegations' people were very keen to rate one another's work and give feedback and critique. Regarding what could be improved, I don’t think that any group activity other than the meetings could be improved; as a group we did not specify meeting times very often and only had one meeting where all members attended. Other than that, all issues really stemmed individually for example, I was the only one to really start doing creating content/website for the first week or so which isn't inherently and issue but if things went wrong down the end of the line, I am the only one to have the time to fix it. I was surprised at how outgoing most of our team members were and how willing they were to message me and each other, I had multiple messages late at night asking for opinions and what else they need to do which was very surprising but pleasing to see as I expected most members to be quite reserved. </p>
            <p>Although I have worked in groups previously this report really taught me that I am not alone in groups, as moronic as that sounds. A lot of team members were more than reliable and some doing much better work than myself, so it turned out better to not attempt to do everything and stay in my lane which very much humbled me and made me think how I should work in groups. </p>

            <p>Towards the end of the assessment, the group started to work better as a team. This involves both participation in the work and the communication the group followed with each other. In this project, the group delegated a section of the work to two people, and we used meetings and communications through teams to provide opinions on how we think each part should be and what we should be thinking about in finishing these sections. The key aspect of the team here was communication, without communication the team wouldn’t have functioned as well as it would have, though that was also part of the problem. The group didn’t have many meetings where we could provide opinions and so most of our thoughts were sent through the chats. Going forward, I hope we as a team can improve the number of meetings in other projects to keep misunderstandings to a minimum. </p>
            <p>The thing that was surprising for me was how well the group functioned despite the low number of meetings and how their motivation on the project pushed through despite hiccups on the way. Being part of a group allows an individual to learn more about communication. This communication is where each person learns how they can display and share information in order to have the team work well and understand their job. </p>

            <p>At the start when we first formed our groups, we all seemed a bit closed off or rather shy to communicate, but that did not necessarily mean that we didn’t do the work or contribute. We all knew of what tasks we were responsible for, as well as the deadlines for each task. But as the due date for this assignment grew closer, I have only observed that despite our lack of communication (not many Teams calls) in the beginning stages of this assignment, we have all done our tasks perfectly. I’ve also learnt that each individual member of our group is very keen to help each other and take on each other's tasks to spread the workload, and make sure that we’re all checking and providing feedback on each other’s work. Despite our very minimal number of team meetings via Microsoft Teams, we have all been able to keep each other on track as well as function together. This could only be achieved because each individual member of our group had their own task to work on, but no one person was responsible for a single task. We always tackled our tasks in pairs or groups of three or more. This was to ensure that we all kept each other in check. </p>
            <p>In light of something I have learnt about groups is that, regardless of the minimal team meetings we had, each member of our group was able to stay driven and complete their tasks to perfection. Unlike other groups that I have been with, I can truthfully say that we all get along well together and helped me further understand the meaning of teamwork and how each person can contribute to the group's success.  </p>

            <p>When we first made our group, we quickly were able to get organized and we delegated tasks efficiently, but over the holidays and sometime after we did not communicate well. Despite this, over the final two weeks before the assessment is due, everyone completed their work to a high standard and close to the deadlines we had set. We communicated very well throughout, despite not conducting many meetings and everyone was able to communicate where they were at with the work and if they needed support with anything, meaning that we were all over what needed to be completed with no fears about if someone was not doing their work. Our time management needs improvement, while we did complete the work well and efficiently, the time it took for everyone to start the work was long, with the time between delegation of work when we started properly communicating leaving much to be desired. I was surprised by how well the group worked together and how well everyone got along. Everyone quickly got to know each other, and no one was scared to report any issue they were having and in turn allowed the group to adapt to an issue.  </p>
            <p>What I learned about working in groups during this assignment is that communication early is key, the earlier something is brought up, the better the chances that the group is able to overcome an issue, thankfully this did not happen to an extreme extent with us, but it was something important that I think everyone caught on to during the assignment. </p>

            <p>After the group was initially formed, members were quick to organise the team communication platform and task delegation and set the base ground for the assignment, however the initial progress of the assignment seemed slow and non-collaborative. Members worked on tasks individually and progress updates were rare, over the duration of the assignment, the team broke from their shells and eventually started communicating more and more – this culminated in an online conference call where everyone attended and was able to communicate current status, what needed to be done, and how we all wanted to proceed as a team. We were able to collectively analyse project status, what needed to be prioritised and were able to solve problems promptly and efficiently. Some aspects that could be improved upon was communication in the first half, while it eventually did resolve itself, the quality of all elements could have been improved with team reviews of sections and group collaborative sessions. Collaborative sessions would help the assignment feel more cohesive and less sectioned and increase work output as members would be in a working environment. I was surprised by how much work was completed with a group full of random people, I expected the team workflow would be slow but the quality of communication throughout the assignment was very shocking, team members wouldn’t be afraid to message me about work and I was able to reach out to them about work as well. We were able to communicate directly and help each other in a constructive manner. </p>
            <p>One thing I have learnt from working in a group is how capable everyone is, even in my low moments, the team continued working to a high standard and helped me in spots where I was struggling. I’ve learnt that teams are full of reliable people working towards the same singular goal of completing the assignment and that it’s important to be honest and communicative with your team. </p>

            <p>As the project submission deadline approached, the group was able to kick into high gear and complete each of our delegated tasks very efficiently while also maintaining a high standard of content within each project task. In the first half of the project, communication could have been a bit better as few meetings were conducted. The mid-semester break did put a bit of a hiccup in group collaboration but once we got the ball rolling, everyone was able to perform well. So yes, communication could have been improved, but the way that we were all able to contribute well both individually and collectively is something that I do not think could have been done any better. One thing that was surprising for me was how thorough and content heavy each group was able to write about their designated tasks. That comes across as surprising due to my own group project experiences throughout my schooling years. I have learned that even if some people could have done a little better in the project (myself), we were all still able to support others during the project. Also, I learned that all groups do not necessarily need to have group leaders to perform well, though it may have been wise to do so, to prevent communication drop off at the beginning.  </p>
