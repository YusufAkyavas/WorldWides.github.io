    <h3>Industry Data</h3>
    <div class="person">
      <h4>Yusuf - Cyber Defense Analyst</h4>
      <p>Based on the Burning Glass industry data, security job titles, while it has some openings, similar titles are not as high in demand. Despite this, the skills needed for this work are in demand but in differing positions. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
        <h4>Aaron - Video Game Programmer</h4>
        <p>Programming skills are consistently sought after in the IT industry, with many of the top job titles being based in programming or development. The skills related to being a Video Game Programmer are in high demand outside of this specific role.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
      <h4>Hamish - Cloud Security DevOps</h4>
      <p>Similar to before, security job titles are not in high demand compared to others, but the demand for skills in AWS and similar cloud services are consistent with many networking job titles. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
      <h4>Nick - Systems administrator</h4>
      <p>System Administrators are seemingly in constant demand, while it is not as high as much of the programming and development and has dropped from being in extremely high demand, it still sits above many other job titles according to Burning Glass. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
      <h4>Shivam - Infrastructure Engineer</h4>
      <p>Infrastructure and System Engineers are in high demand according to Burning Glass, the systems engineer job title had some of the most openings and consistently stayed in demand over the two years. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
      <h4>Jet - IT Engineer</h4>
      <p>While Support Engineer job titles are minimum, System Engineer titles are in high demand as stated before, with it consistently being one of the most in demand over the two years according to burning glass.  </p>
    </div>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 1.8em;">As a group</h4>
    <p>While Support Engineer job titles are minimum, System Engineer titles are in high demand as stated before, with it consistently being one of the most in demand over the two years according to burning glass.  </p>
    <p>Based on our group's ideal jobs, our casual skills include communication and teamwork. All the jobs listed require the ability to work well in a team and have clear communication, these skills are important for efficiency and help with all aspects of work in the industry. </p>
    <p>Knowledge in programming languages such as Python and Java are required. Having an understanding in programming languages is important for most IT work, but through our Ideal jobs, Java and Python are consistent throughout each at minimum as a positive not a requirement despite this the language needed does vary between jobs. Technical support skills are needed for most of our ideal jobs, most involving creating, fixing and maintaining IT systems for various reasons. </p>
    <p>According to Burning Glass, knowledge of programming languages, specifically Java is a highly sought-after skill with knowledge in both Java and JavaScript being two of the highest IT skills sought after, with both staying consistently in the top 4 most in demand over 2016 to 2018  </p>
    <p>Careful analysis of the 2018 Burning Glass statistics, the top three IT specific skill sets that employerâ€™s seek within their employees, or potential candidates include extensive knowledge in SQL, Microsoft Windows and SAP. With regards to the technical skills that employers are sought after, general skills that employers find crucial within their employees, according to the Burning Glass 2018 data shows that employers find Communication skills, Problem Solving skills and Organizational skills rank top three among all other baseline skills. This data shows consecutively for years 2017, and 2018, employers find Communication skills and problem solving as the top two most sought-after general skills within an employee.  </p>
    <p>Having looked and carefully analyzed the Burning Glass data about the most crucial traits that an employee must have, especially in the eyes of an employer, it is highly recommended that to be perceived as the ideal employee, we must have a broad knowledge not only of the requirements that the job requires, but also of the ability to be flexible and diversify our knowledge and skillsets in order to exceed and perform better than expected. While our group has many talents and skills that meet their respective job requirements, with the results given of the Burning Glass data, it is better that our individual skills (communication, teamwork, etc.) are further fine-tuned, this is to exceed the expectations of the employer.   </p>
