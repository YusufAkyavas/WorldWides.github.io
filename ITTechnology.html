  <div class="collapsiblecontent">
    <p>Cybersecurity is an extremely relevant and important technology in this almost exclusively connected world. Although it is technically a technology, it is more an aspect of technology; with almost all technology needing to consider its cybersecurity properties these days. Cybersecurity itself is the “practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks” (IBM, 2021), this means that it is the responsibility of an individual, corporation or application to combat threats against any technology that is networked. Currently Cybersecurity is at an all-time high in defense but also at an all-time high with attacks as years go on the threats grow consistently, according to techjury.net globally 30,000 websites are hacked daily, 64% of all companies worldwide have experienced at least one form of cyber-attack and every 39 seconds there is a new attack somewhere on the web. This is easily visible even for someone just making a website for yourself, if you start up a blank website with an open html access control list policy you will see the many attempted connections port scanning to see for backdoors into your system every day. An example of state-of-the-art Cybersecurity tactics/technologies would be zero-trust environments combined with software-defined perimeters. Zero-trust provides a network or device control over what is visible to a user by using a verification system on every communication while combining constant enumeration of the user’s device so that once the potential threat has timed out the “distant end system can no longer be identified, as not ports will respond to inquiries”.  This kind of technology can be used on many kinds of systems and devices and creates an extremely secure user control policy that helps prevent the chance of cyber attack.
    </p>
    <p>Since Cybersecurity is such a constant changing field what can be done in the future is very hard to dictate but although this is not necessarily a technology what is predictable because it is consistently changing and improving is the idea of “human firewalls”, that certain users and companies are becoming aware of cybersecurity challenges so the knowledge to protect entire environments is improving based on the average user's knowledge of the field, this does not have to be major like knowing how the attacks actually occur; even small knowledge like how to spot phishing emails and daily virus scans are extremely effective at keeping the threat of small attacks minimal, of course this does not protect from high tier attacks but that is the job for security specialists. This is usually done through company-based policies or even just the normalization of technologies like password managers and VPNs or even just personal experience with how much threat there is in the world today. This is made possible not only by the growing field of cybersecurity but also other technologies in the world today that highlight its importance such as the average user's VPN’s or biometrics becoming a main standing on laptops and phones. Another reason that this is so effective is because although it may be the average user learning about cyber-attacks these “average users” can sometimes include executives of large companies who in the past have not taken cybersecurity seriously and not given it the funding that it deserves. For example, a company 10 years ago may have just got the engineers to provide the security for all applications and networks but these days it is commonplace in secure companies at least for a specific security expert to be hired. This is shown through how much money there is in cybersecurity today, a cybersecurity specialist can be paid $150,000+ for a role in a large company, with “cybersecurity startups raising a record shattering $29.5 billion in venture capital last year, more than doubling the $12 billion raised in 2020”.
    </p>
    <p>Because of the growing knowledge of cybersecurity and the threats that every company faces, cybersecurity is an ever-growing field with thousands of extremely well-paying jobs being made every year and that statistic is likely only going to grow as more and more companies face cyber attacks and crises and realise that they need professionals in that field. Although this will increase the cyber security of almost every company and application over the years, cyber security experts are still swamped with how many attacks there are and that is only likely to grow. This is very easily shown by websites like threatmap.checkpoint.com which shows that the top targeted industries are “education, government and Isps” and also highlights how global these threats are with countries like “Mongolia, Georgia and Nepal” being the highest rate of attacks per organization.  This will mean that jobs in these countries and sectors will continue to grow in the cybersecurity field, while companies and governments will increase the budget on cyber related policies and fields.
