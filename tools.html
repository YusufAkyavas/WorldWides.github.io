    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <p>The tools used to create this assignment are as follows</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 1.8em;">
      <li>Teams</li>
      <li>Word</li>
      <li>Github + Github Pages</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To create this assignmentwe used GitHub Pages with the link of</p>
    <a href="https://yusufakyavas.github.io/WorldWides.github.io">https://yusufakyavas.github.io/WorldWides.github.io/</a>
    <p>Hamish and Shivam, were delegated and tasked with the creation of the website with the GitHub repository being created by Yusuf (https://github.com/YusufAkyavas/WorldWides.github.io). </p>
    <p>To design and create this website, there was not much discussion in our meetings about the colour design it was very much just done and then reflected on. We used Atom and VS code as the text editor with the built-in git functionality, this made collaboration seamless between IDE’s. At first, we were planning to just make one page for the entire document but because of how large the documents got, We did not want a singular very large page, so we split it into multiple sections with their own html pages. Regarding CSS, nothing fancy was done, we used the same stylesheet for every page as it keeps consistency, and we did not try to make any animations for most pages. The stylesheet emphasizes the main ideas behind our project concept, we plan on making a herb finder using the google maps API, so the website emphasizes green “earthy” colours. Content on the website is contained within a div with a ‘content’ class, this allows for a uniform design language site-wide and makes the primary focus on information rather than design. Various HTML elements of the website are accented alongside the site-wide green theme to increase contrast and readability, buttons are a darker green to hint that the element is clickable. The tables featured on the ideal jobs page shift to darker aqua marine to highlight the focus of the page. Hamish ended up adding in some JavaScript for the IT Technologies page, this was because of how long this section is; with 4 people needing to write IT reports each it looks much nicer to have collapsible sections based on technologies so there was some simple JavaScript implemented to achieve this.  </p>
    <p>Reflecting on how we used these tools as a group and how the group functioned overall. This is easily seen with the Git Log, with Yusuf creating the index and style sheet and providing the first commit this laid out the groundwork for Shivam and Hamish to create the website as delegated. Using the git logs as reference we can see that the first actual content change was April 23rd by Hamish, from april 23rd until the 27th it was mostly Hamish adding content and some CSS although on the 27th Shivam (Oliver/”gattlegun”) where Shivam’s expertise in web design came through and was able to make an aesthetically pleasing website while also focusing on site readability, design, accessibility, and refactoring. From then on, both Hamish and Shivam contributed equally to complete the website until the due date of May 1st. This really reflects the idea of we were a bit late to all collaborate but once we did it was done quickly. </p>
