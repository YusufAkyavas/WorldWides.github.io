    <a href="https://yusufakyavas.github.io/WorldWides.github.io">https://yusufakyavas.github.io/WorldWides.github.io/</a>
    <p>Hamish and Shivam, were delegated and tasked with the creation of the website with the GitHub repository being created by Yusuf (https://github.com/YusufAkyavas/WorldWides.github.io). </p>
    <p>To design and create this website, there was not much discussion in our meetings about the colour design it was very much just done and then reflected on. We used Atom as the text editor with the built-in git functionality, it made it easy to use. At first, we were planning to just make one page for the entire document but because of how large the documents got, I did not want a singular very large page, so we split it into multiple sections with their own html pages. In regard to CSS nothing fancy was done, we used the same stylesheet for every page as it keeps consistency, and we did not try to make any animations for most pages. Hamish ended up adding in some JavaScript for the IT Technologies page, this was because of how long this section is; with 4 people needing to write IT reports each it looks much nicer to have collapsible sections based on technologies so there was some simple JavaScript implemented to achieve this.  </p>
