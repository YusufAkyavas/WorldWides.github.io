    <h4>Yusuf Akyavas</h4>
    <p>Hello! My name is Yusuf Akyavas, and I am a current student in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT. I was born in Australia from two Turkish parents. I have two older brothers and we all speak both English and Turkish together, it varies from time to time. I went to a private school called Sirius College and spent my entire primary and secondary education there and graduated with a year 12 Certificate. I really enjoy playing video games and other tabletop games as well. The type of video games I play varies but I mostly enjoy playing cooperative games in which I can play with friends because I believe that experiences with other people are much more enjoyable than on your own. I also have two cats. Their names are Kestane which translates to “chestnut” in Turkish and Kimba which is from “Kimba The White Lion”(He is a white cat).

      My interest in IT started since a young age. My brothers are a lot older than me and so they had access to technology and devices which I did not. I would always enjoy watching them play a game and began wondering why it worked that way. As I got older I started to try and understand how changing something in the code changes the games or websites experience, but I was never fully invested. I only started getting really interested in the past few years as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown and I was spending more time on the computer. This led to wanting to go to university with a bachelors or Information Technology. I chose to go to RMIT as it was the university that my oldest brother had gone to for his education in IT and he taught me about IT. It was also the easiest to go to as the other universities were very far away. From this IT course I hopefully will learn a broad range of knowledge which I can apply to my career and personal life and use the skills gained to help people in the field of IT. I would like to continually learn and grow and develop my IT skills for use in the future.

      <h4>Hamish Dean-Graham S3932237</h4>
      <p>My full name Is Hamish Dean-Graham with my student number being s3932237, I have lived in Australia my entire life and have a deep interest in technology mainly being backend and legacy applications. My hobbies include messing with old computers, gym and baking. I am interested in IT because I grew up around it constantly and for experience, I have been working in the industry for the past two years as a DevOp intern which then transitioned to a operational engineer grad. I am part of the sickest dudes. IT appeals to me is because of how much I have been exposed to it. My family founded a Telecommunications billing software development company, and for the past 2 years I have been working there as a "Devops Intern" which then transitioned into "Operational engineer grad" So I have been extremely lucky to already be included into the field of IT and experience what the industry is like. After seeing many people at the company I work at come from RMIT with lots of valuable skills not only with the software but communication/business skills I decided to transfer from my Swinburne computer science course to IT in RMIT. Especially with classes going back on campus I am excited to have a full university experience and hope to bring my extroverted nature into my IT work.

      <h4>Jet Cronin</h4>
      <p>I am a recent highschool graduate from Albert Park College from which I graduated in 2021, my studies focused on the sciences and music. I have lived in Melbourne, Australia my whole life but have traveled around Europe and some parts of Asia but am only able to speak English. I have interests in music and have a background with music production and the music industry but my passion for music lies with the metal scene with much of my time spent searching for new bands to listen to. I also have a deep appreciation for the sciences, specifically astronomy and I always enjoy keeping up to date with the latest studies and papers surrounding this topic.
      </p>
      <p>My interest in IT began when I was exposed to music production and the technology used. I was intrigued by the way the devices communicated to each other and how each plugin worked and learned how AI is used to produce effects and its uses in things like autotune. This progressed into researching AI in the music industry and its progression with many recent machine learning and AI programs being developed to produce its own music though this is still in its infancy. With my interest in space I was also intrigued by how astronomers research the universe and have interest in the systems used to discover and catalog extra terrestrial bodies using AI and machine learning. Despite being interested in these systems I have little IT experience outside of basic research. My decision to come to RMIT was influenced by my family as some recommended that RMIT was the university that was best suited for me. I started looking into RMIT’s astrophysics course during an open day but found myself drawn towards the computer science and IT departments and decided to further look into what I would learn through the IT related courses. I was impressed by the environment in RMIT and was encouraged to go by those around me to pursue an education here. During my studies I hope to develop the skills and understanding in security systems, AI and machine learning and expand my knowledge with IT systems. I wish to understand how AI and machine learning systems are developed and how they are influencing how we use computers. I want to understand security systems further and develop an understanding of the importance of such systems.
