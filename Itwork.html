    <p>To interview an IT professional, Yusuf and Hamish began discussing over teams about who they could do. Luckily Hamish already works in an IT field and has many coworkers who would be considered an IT professional. This led to Yusuf and Hamish choosing Michael Hanrahan (https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-hanrahan-b9a45391/), a Solution Development Lead at CSG International who is a veteran in the telecommunications industry.
    </p>
    <p>The interview was conducted in person at the Melbourne CSG office. It was organized through a calendar invite on teams so that we could organize well with Michaels busy schedule. The meeting was recorded through voice after permission was given, while Hamish asked the questions and Yusuf wrote down observations. The transcript and recording can be found in the appendix.</p>
    <p>Michael is a Solution Development lead, we asked him about his IT work and what he does. He had a very brief response regarding how “it varies on a day-to-day basis” but mostly its customizing and extending software to meet customer requirements. This means that not only does he work with developers and designers he is directly working with customers. This is to “work out integrations” as well as implement and managing testing for software. Yusuf and I were very interested in how he started doing that sort of work, Michael responded that “I pretty much came into this position straight out of uni, I guess I was doing more of a broad range of development at the start”. Afterwards Michael described the industry that he works in, mainly the telecommunications industry and how it can be quite complicated once it reaches the enterprise customers; on-top of describing how a lot of it is legacy.

    Because of Michael’s management-based role he interacts with many kinds of people, during the interview he kindly gave us a rundown of most of them. One of these are analysts who “come up with the business requirements as opposed to the technical requirements” he mentioned how they usually work with the customer to work out specific business requirements from an end-user perspective. Another was architects who do a similar thing but “work on more a technical view” and are responsible for the system integration and the larger architecture. “There's QA engineers or testers” Michael really highlights that a Tester’s purpose was to give “everyone the confidence that what you have built is to the requirements”. And the last one highlighted were the project managers, who are tasked with the overall delivery and keeping track of resources, time and cost. And of course, outside of the business there Is customers. Out of all these groups Michael said that he spends the most time with the analysts and testers, because when you’re building and delivering for Michael those are the two most important roles to work alongside, especially since these groups are the ones who ask the most questions. Regarding what work Michael spends most of his time on he said, “it's a mix of design and the actual coding”, Michael then highlights that it is “always cheaper and less time consuming to fix a problem close to the start”. This means that there is a lot of time spent thinking about how things are going to be written and how everything fits together to minimize issues. Michael then highlights the importance of designing code to save the time of other colleagues as well due to code reviews needing to be done by them which can waste their time.
    </p>
    <p>Hamish asked if Michael found the coding aspect of the job the most challenging or other aspects. Michael found that other aspects are more challenging and “thankfully they happen less often”, due to the role he is in it can sometimes get a bit tricky on a “larger almost architecture level”. His description of why this is difficult goes “Where you have two systems that are essentially movable objects, you’ve got a project to run maybe there’s an implementation of another system outside of your control and they've got a project to run”. So, he mentions that negotiating all of this is probably the hardest part but luckily if “we’ve done the design and architecture right from the start, then these sorts of things don’t happen”. So that seems to be the most challenging aspect, the actual communication and negotiation between customers.
